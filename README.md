## Getting Started

1. `cd <project_dir>`
1. `pnpm install`
   - no pnpm? no problem. `npm install -g pnpm` or npm / yarn classic work fine.

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
